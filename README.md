# AirMouse 

### Ongoing project - alpha version

AirMouse redefines the way we interact with our computers. Built using Electron and Mediapipe, this application allows you to control your mouse pointer simply by pointing and gesturing with your fingers.

By leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision, AirMouse translates your hand movements into mouse pointer movements and commands to no only enhances your productivity but also liberate you from the constraints of traditional input devices. Whether you're presenting, designing, coding, or just browsing, AirMouse provides a seamless and intuitive experience. It's not just a new way to control your computer - it's a whole new way to experience it.

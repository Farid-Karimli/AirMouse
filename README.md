# AirMouse

AirMouse redefines the way we interact with our computers. Built using Electron and Mediapipe, this application allows you to control your cursor simply by pointing and gesturing with your fingers.

By leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision, AirMouse translates your finger movements into cursor movements on the screen. This not only enhances your productivity but also liberates you from the constraints of traditional input devices.

Whether you're presenting, designing, coding, or just browsing, AirMouse provides a seamless and intuitive experience. It's not just a new way to control your computer - it's a whole new way to experience it.
